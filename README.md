# Product Ecosystem

## What is Product Ecosystem?
In our day-to-day life, we see a lot of companies of a particular industry rest on an ecosystem or a platform of products.

Smartphones rest on different apps as without apps no one would need a smartphones in their day to day life. This is the reason apple keeps its own app development environment and its own unique apps and services to retain the customer. If someone is already enrolled into some services then they will eventually upgrade to a different apple iphone rather than shifting to a different phone brand. This is the importance of building an ecosystem.

## Project Theme
In this project, the theme is about understanding if this business strategy is successful in other industries compared to the traditional ways of Hierarchies and Buy-Sell Markets. I had datasets of the banking industry and the Telecom Industry. I selected the banking industry as it will be relatable after experiencing the jio revolution.
